 hello world !


i am trying to do my first push with linux i hope that it will work and appears in the github 

thank you  i  hope also that i will develop my self to know more and more 

see ya later folks

by the way i am using vim  on linux to  push it 

the commandes was so easy : 

1 - open your terminal  
2 - see wich version   of  git is installed in your system  with the commande  : git version
3 -  check  the version if it does not appear  that you have to install git  cause it is not installed yet 

4 -  use the commande :  git config --global user.name YourUserName  { to set your user name } 
5 -  use the commande  :  git config --global  user.email YourUserEmail@.com { to set your  email } 
6 -   now  we  do forking  what ever this means  : haha look    go to :
		1- your github> create a new repository > set ip up >  copy the link  that is given to you 

7 - go back to your terminal and  use the commande  : git clone https://XXXXXXXXX 

8 -  now you have the repository on your  root or what ever you have  . 
 9 -  after writing this documment on my terminal i ll try to push it to the main repository  
  10  - we will   use the commande git add  fileName.what ever extension 
 11 -  commande  git statut to see   if its modified  
12  -  i ve strugled little bit to push it   hahah but it is here now 
13 - i have used the commande  : git  branch -M main  
14 -  next commande  : git push  -u origin main 
15  - they asked for user name   
16 -  the asked for password  : note that the password is the token access generated  
 17 -  and here  the push is completed   

see you  in real pushes   thank youewfrikjfweokjve
